# Sentiment Analysis Models

This repository contains code for sentiment analysis using both Deep Learning (LSTM) and traditional Machine Learning models.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluation is stored in `data.csv`. It contains labeled text data along with sentiment labels.

## Deep Learning Model & Machine Learning Models

The `SentimentAnalysis.ipynb` notebook contains the code for sentiment analysis using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network implemented with Keras and the code for sentiment analysis using traditional machine learning classifiers like SVM, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.

## Usage

Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/Sentiment-Analysis-Models.git
cd Sentiment-Analysis-Models

## Dependencies

```bash
pip install numpy pandas nltk keras tensorflow scikit-learn
```
